ExTick is a simple project management application supporting Kanban and Scrum projects. It is built using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix), and [LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view).

This is a toy project to learn Elixir and Phoenix. It is not intended for production use.
